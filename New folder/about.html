            <h3>Our Story</h3>
            <p>
                Founded in 2025, MTG Boats began as a small family-owned boat dealership with a passion for the water.
                What started as a modest operation with just three boats in inventory has grown into one of the region's most
                trusted marine dealerships, serving thousands of satisfied customers.
